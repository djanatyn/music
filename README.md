music
=====

## what is this?
My music collection.

## isn't that big?
It's not actually stored in git, I'm using [git-annex](https://git-annex.branchable.com).

## what are these files, then?
They're symlinks to "annexed" music files, stored in Backblaze B2.

## what are these nix scripts?
They're reproducible "builds" to fetch music files from remote sources.

## how do I listen to this?
You can't, sorry! You can just see what I like listening to.
